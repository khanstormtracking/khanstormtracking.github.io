earlier this morning, although the latest radar and satellite 
imagery shows a new band forming in the northern semicircle.  This 
decrease was likely caused by a combination of shear and dry air 
entrainment, and it has caused the cyclone to weaken.  Aircraft and 
surface observations indicate the central pressure has risen to 
near 1004 mb, and the initial intensity is decreased to a possibly 
generous 55 kt based on aircraft and Doppler radar data.

After a slight jog to the left, the storm has resumed a motion of 
360/12. This motion should continue for the next 12 h or so until 
landfall occurs across the northwestern Florida peninsula. 
Thereafter, a gradual turn toward the north-northeast is expected 
by, followed by acceleration toward the northeast as Elsa moves 
into the mid-latitude westerlies.  The forecast guidance has 
shifted a little to the left since the last advisory, and the new 
forecast track is also nudged in that direction.  The new track 
lies a little to the right of the various consensus models.

While little change in strength is forecast before landfall, there 
is a chance that the new convection could cause a short-lived 
re-intensification.  So, based on this possibility a hurricane 
warning remains in effect for portions of the west coast of 
Florida.  After landfall, Elsa should weaken as it crosses the 
southeastern United States, followed by some re-intensification as 
it accelerates back over the Atlantic.  The system is expected to 
become extratropical by the time it reaches the Canadian Maritimes 
in 72 h.  The new intensity forecast is at the upper edge of the 
guidance envelope and has only minor adjustments from the previous 
forecast.<br /><strong>-----------------------------------------------</strong><br /><strong>FORECAST CONE<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><img src="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/AT05/refresh/AL052021_5day_cone_no_line_and_wind+png/144732_5day_cone_no_line_and_wind.png" /><br /></strong><strong>-----------------------------------------------</strong><br />NEXT FULL ADVISORY AT 1500UTC WED JULY 7TH 2021 <br /><strong>-----------------------------------------------</strong> <br />INFORMATION FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER<br /><em>$$<br /></em>FORECASTER ABBY</pre>
