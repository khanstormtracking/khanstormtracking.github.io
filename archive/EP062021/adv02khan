wind shear.  Given the recent development of a small inner-core, it 
seems likely that Felicia will continue to strengthen during the 
next couple of days.  The only caveat appears to be nearby dry air 
that could get entrained into the circulation of the relatively 
small tropical cyclone and cause some disruptions in the 
intensification process. Although most of the intensity guidance is 
not extremely bullish and the rapid intensification probabilities 
are not particularly high, the NHC forecast predicts steady 
strengthening and brings Felicia to hurricane status within 24 
hours.  The NHC wind speed forecast is in best agreement with the 
HFIP corrected consensus model, which is at the upper-end of the 
guidance. 

The tropical storm is moving west-northwestward or 285/13 kt. A 
mid-level ridge to the north of Felicia should steer the storm 
west-northwestward to westward during the next 12-24 h. After that 
time, the orientation of the ridge shifts slightly which is expected 
to cause Felicia to turn west-southwestward with some decrease in 
forward speed during the middle portion of the forecast period.  
The dynamical model guidance is in reasonably good agreement, and 
the NHC forecast lies near the TVCE consensus aid.  The guidance 
envelope did shift a little southward from the previous cycle, and 
the new NHC forecast has been modified accordingly. <br /><strong>-----------------------------------------------</strong><br /><strong>FORECAST CONE<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><img src="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/EP06/refresh/EP062021_5day_cone_no_line_and_wind+png/083637_5day_cone_no_line_and_wind.png" /><br /></strong>-----------------------------------------------<br />NEXT FULL ADVISORY AT 0300UTC WED JULY 15TH 2021 <br />----------------------------------------------- <br />INFORMATION FROM THE <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/">NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER</a><br /><em>$<br /></em>FORECASTER KHAN</pre>
