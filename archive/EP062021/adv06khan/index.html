ABOUT 855 MI...1380 KM SW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...110 MPH...175 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...971 MB...28.68 INCHES<br /><strong>-----------------------------------------------</strong><br /><strong>WATCHES AND WARNINGS<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /></strong>There are no warnings and watches associated with Hurricane Felicia<br /><strong>-----------------------------------------------</strong><br /><strong>KEY MESSAGES<br />-----------------------------------------------</strong><br />There are currently no Key Messages for Hurricane Felicia<br /><strong>-----------------------------------------------</strong><br /><strong>DISCUSSION<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /></strong>Satellite imagery indicates that Felicia has continued to rapidly
strengthen this evening. Infrared temperatures have significantly
warmed within the eye during the past couple hours, and deep
convection within the eyewall has become more symmetric. A closed
ring of infrared cloud top temperatures colder than -65 to -70 deg
Celsius now completely surrounds the eye of Felicia. Based on these
current satellite trends, the initial intensity is raised to 95 kt
for this advisory. This lies between the TAFB subjective Dvorak
current intensity estimate of 90 kt and UW-CIMSS ADT objective
estimates of around 100 kt.

Warm sea-surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear along
Felicia's forecast track are expected to allow for some additional
strengthening in the short-term, especially since dry air in the
surrounding environment has had minimal impact on the cyclone's
intensification up to this point. The official NHC intensity
forecast has been adjusted upward and now brings Felicia to major
hurricane status (Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind
Scale) within 12 h. The NHC forecast remains higher than the
guidance consensus through the first 72 h, then generally follows
the HFIP corrected consensus approach (HCCA) thereafter. The cyclone
is forecast to slowly weaken this weekend within a drier, more
stable mid-level environment. However, the forecast track keeps
Felicia south of the 26 deg C isotherm, which should allow the
cyclone to maintain its hurricane intensity through much of the
forecast period.

Felicia is still moving almost due west at around 8 kt. As the
steering ridge becomes positioned to the northwest of Felicia, the
cyclone is expected to move west-southwestward during the next day
or so. Then, Felicia is forecast to resume a more westward motion
for the next several days as the cyclone moves to the south of a
subtropical ridge. The track guidance remains tightly clustered
through much of the period. The official NHC forecast is adjusted
just a bit slower and slightly farther north than the previous one,
bringing it closer to the usually reliable consensus aids TVCE and
HCCA.<br /><strong>-----------------------------------------------<br /></strong><strong>FORECAST CONE<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><img src="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/EP06/refresh/EP062021_5day_cone_no_line_and_wind+png/025129_5day_cone_no_line_and_wind.png" /><br /></strong>FORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS<br />INIT  16/0300Z 15.2N 120.2W   95 KT 110 MPH
