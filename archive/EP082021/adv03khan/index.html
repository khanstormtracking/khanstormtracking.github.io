DISCUSSION
-----------------------------------------------
</strong>Hilda has resumed strengthening during the past several hours, 
including the short-lived appearance of an eye in the central 
dense overcast.  Recent 37-GHz microwave imagery confirms an eye 
is developing, but indicates that the eyewall is not yet closed on 
the northeastern side of the eye.  Satellite intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are 77 kt, while the CIMSS satellite consensus is 
near 80 kt.  Based on these data, the initial intensity is increased 
to a possibly conservative 75 kt.

Although Hilda is experiencing some easterly vertical shear, 
conditions are generally conducive for strengthening during the 
next 24 h, and the early part of the intensity forecast has been 
adjusted upward based mainly on current trends.  After that 
time, decreasing moisture and decreasing sea surface temperatures 
along the forecast track should cause steady weakening.  The latter 
part of the intensity forecast has only minor changes from the 
previous forecast and follows the trend of the intensity guidance.

The initial motion is now a little slower at 285/9.  The 
subtropical ridge to the north should steer Hilda generally 
west-northwestward for the next several days, with a more 
northwestward motion around 96 h as the cyclone passes south of a 
weakness in the ridge.  Overall, the guidance envelope has shifted a 
little northward since the previous advisory, and the new forecast 
track is also adjusted northward.  It should be noted, though, that 
the global models continue to show the possibility of erratic motion 
due to Hilda interacting with TD-9E to the west and the weaker, but 
larger, low pressure area to the east.  The most drastic example of 
this is in the Canadian model, which shows Hilda taking a 
significant turn to the south before resuming a northward motion.a will be near cooler 
waters in 2 to 3 days.  Therefore, Hilda is likely to reach its 
peak intensity in about 48 hours, and the NHC intensity forecast at 
that time is near the upper end of the guidance suite.  Hilda is 
expected to move over even cooler waters after 48 hours, which 
should cause a gradual weakening trend through the end of the 
forecast period.
