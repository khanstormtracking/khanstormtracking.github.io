        <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER DISCUSSION</strong></p>
        <pre style="text-align:center;">The hurricane is gradually losing strength.  Satellite images show 
that the eye has become more cloud filled, with Sam's ring of deep 
convection becoming less intense and two main towers in the 
southeast and northwest quadrants.  Still, the tropical cyclone is 
quite a sight even on full-disk images with a large distinctive 
cloud pattern. The latest intensity estimates have decreased, so 
the initial wind speed is set to 110 kt, with higher uncertainty 
than average in this figure due to recent recon/satellite 
differences. 

Sam wisely has avoided much shear during its 10-day journey across 
the Atlantic, and it could remain a major hurricane for another 
day or so.  However, in 36 hours or so, the system should move 
north of the Gulf Stream, which would normally cause a dramatic 
weakening.  But in this case, a favorable mid-latitude trough 
interaction should cause Sam to transition into a large and 
powerful extratropical low by 60 hours.  After that, it loses its 
baroclinic forcing and should gradually spin down over the far North 
Atlantic southwest of Iceland.  Guidance is in fairly solid 
agreement on this scenario, and the new intensity forecast is 
mostly just an update of the previous one, remaining close to the 
consensus.

The system continues moving northeastward at about 15 kt.   Sam 
should move faster to the northeast by Monday as it encounters 
stronger wind flow between a deep-layer ridge to the east and a 
large mid- to upper-level low over Atlantic Canada.  The track will 
weave leftward a bit at longer ranges due to the upper trough 
pulling the extratropical system north-northeastward at times, and 
eventually another trough has a similar tug by day 5. There are no 
significant changes to the previous forecast with guidance in close 
agreement. 

Key Messages:

1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These 
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
 Please consult products from your local weather office.

        <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>JOINT TYPHOON WARNING CENTER DISCUSSION</strong></p>
        <pre style="text-align:center;">Shaheen-Gulab is located 454 km north-northeast of Masirah Island, 
and has moved west-southwestward at 11 km/h (6 knots) over the past 6 hours.
Shaheen-Gulab is currently tracking west-southwestward along the southeastern 
edge of a steering ridge to the northwest. As the steering ridge continues to build, 
the system will continue to be pushed west-southwestward and then turn slightly 
southwestward after landfall in Oman. The previous forecast track had Shaheen-Gulab 
not turning west-southwestward until about the next 18 hours. However, the previously 
mentioned infrared imagery clearly shows the system is already turning west-southwestward. 
This minor change in track will shorten the system's time over water, which allows less time 
for intensification before landfall. The marginally favorable environment will allow for a
 peak intensity of 150 km/h (80 knots) just before landfall at 24 hours. Afterwards, land interaction 
will rapidly degrade the system to 55 km/h (30 knots) in 2 days. Forecast guidance is in good agreement 
with all models showing a westward track followed by a slight turn west-southwestward before landfall, 
with a 83 km cross-spread at landfall in around 24 hours. However, since none of the models are showing 
the current west-southwestward turn, the forecast track is slightly south of consensus at landfall. Intensity 
guidance is now less supportive of further intensification with HWRF unrealistically showing rapid intensification 
over the next 12 hours, peaking at 175 km/h (95 knots) at 12 hours.

The rest of the models show either minor intensification or are stagnantly followed by a rapid weakening at landfall.

Maximum significant wave height is 5.8 meters (19 feet).

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://tropic.ssec.wisc.edu/real-time/adt/20LP.GIF">
        <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER CENTER DISCUSSION</strong></p>
        <pre style="text-align:center;">Victor remains a tropical cyclone this evening, with pulsing deep 
convection occuring primarily north of the well-defined low-level 
center. However, this convection lacks much organization and is 
continually being stripped away by around 20 kt of 
south-southwesterly vertical wind shear. Earlier this evening, there 
was an ASCAT-A pass valid at 2238 UTC which had peak wind retrievals 
of 25-30 kt to the northeast of the center. There was also a nearby 
moored ocean buoy that at 0000 UTC reported sustained winds of 28 kt 
with a pressure of 1006.7 mb also just northeast of Victor. The 
latest advisory intensity is thus being maintained at 30 kt but the 
minimum pressure was lowered a bit due to this in-situ buoy data. 
The 30 kt intensity also agrees with most recent TAFB Dvorak CI 
estimate from 0000 UTC.

Ultimately the combination of southwesterly vertical wind shear and
the associated entrainment of dry air will prove victorious against
Victor, with the depression forecast to gradually weaken during the
forecast period. The latest NHC intensity forecast still shows
Victor becoming a remnant low by tomorrow evening, though 27 to
28 C sea surface temperatures could still support sheared
convective bursts to the north of the low center into early next
week. Victor's low-level wind field will also continue to spin down
over the subsequent days, and the circulation is forecast to open
up into a trough by Tuesday. The latest forecast is essentially
unchanged from the previous one and is in good agreement with the
consensus aids and deterministic model output.

The depression continues to move to the northwest at 310/12 kt
though with the occasional tug poleward by the convection on its
northern side. This northwestward motion is expected to continue as
Victor remains embedded in the flow around a low-level subtropical
anticyclone to its northeast. The NHC track forecast continues to be
in general agreement with the track guidance consensus, maintaining
Victor on a similar forward motion until the system opens up into a
trough in 2-3 days.
