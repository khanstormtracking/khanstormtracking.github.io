        <pre style="text-align:center;">Peter continues to just barely maintain its classification as a 
tropical cyclone. While the low-level circulation has remained 
intact today, the convection continues to be located well downshear 
to the east. However, there have been a few convective elements 
forming a bit closer to the center recently and that is the 
primarily justification for maintaining advisories on Peter as 
a tropical cyclone this afternoon. The initial intensity is 
maintained at 30 kt given the earlier scatterometer data, though 
this might be generous. Continued strong southwesterly vertical wind 
shear within a dry mid-level environment should ultimately strip the 
remaining convection away from Peter, with the tropical cyclone 
expected to finally peter out as a post-tropical remnant low in the 
next 12 hours. 

The depression has been moving very slowly recently, with an 
estimated north-northwestward motion of 340/4 kt. The cyclone is 
expected to turn northward and then north-northeastward following a 
weakness in the low-level ridge until the system finally opens up 
into a trough, sometime in the 48 to 60 hour period.

        <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER DISCUSSION</strong></p>
        <pre style="text-align:center;">Rose is currently comprised of a swirl of low-level clouds, with 
the only significant convection occurring about 120 n mi southeast 
of the center.  Satellite intensity estimates have decreased, and 
are now 25 kt from TAFB and too weak to classify from SAB.  Based 
mainly on earlier scatterometer data, the initial intensity is held 
at a possibly generous 30 kt.  Rose remain in an area of 
northwesterly shear and upper-level convergence, and dry mid-level 
air has been entraining into the circulation.  The large-scale model 
guidance indicates that the hostile conditions will continue for at 
least another 36 h, and based on model forecasts of convection Rose 
is now expected to degenerate into a remnant low pressure area in 
24 h or less.  It should be noted that the GFS and HWRF models 
suggest the possibility that convection could re-develop in the 
48-96 h period due to the remnant low interacting with an 
upper-level trough.  For now, the intensity forecast will not call 
for re-generation at that time.

The initial motion is now west-northwestward or 300/9 kt.  A 
northwestward motion is expected for the next 12-24 hours as Rose or 
its remnants are steered by a mid-level ridge over the eastern 
Atlantic.  After that time, the system is expected to turn 
northward, northeastward, and eventually east-northeastward as it 
becomes steered by a deep-layer trough that includes the remnants 
of Odette.  Since Rose has moved a bit to the west of the previous 
forecast, the guidance and the new forecast track have also shifted 
westward during the first 36 h. The new NHC track is to the east of 
the consensus models for the first 36 h, and close to the consensus 
aids after that time.

        <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER DISCUSSION</strong></p>
        <pre style="text-align:center;">The tropical wave that NHC has been monitoring over the last several 
days has gradually become better organized. The satellite structure 
in particular is quite impressive for a tropical depression, with 
both the 1800 UTC subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB 
at T2.5/35 kt. This bigger question, however, was if the system 
possessed a well-defined closed earth-relative circulation. An 
ASCAT-C pass from earlier this morning hinted that the circulation 
was becoming better defined, with the development of westerly 
low-level winds to the south of the convective shield. This westerly 
low-level flow is also confirmed by atmospheric motion vectors 
(AMVs) available from the GOES-16 meso domain over the system. While 
the low-level circulation may still be somewhat broad, it now 
appears to be well-defined enough to mark the formation of a 
tropical cyclone. The initial intensity is set at 30-kt, in 
agreement with peak wind retrievals of 28-30 kt by the earlier 
scatterometer data.  

The initial motion is estimated to be at 270/13 kt, though this is 
somewhat uncertain given that the center has only recently formed. 
An expansive mid-level ridge is located to the north and west of 
the cyclone, which should maintain its heading toward the west, 
though with a gradual gain in latitude as the system approaches 
the western extent of the ridge by day 5. The track guidance is in 
excellent agreement on this track evolution for the first three 
days, with just a bit more spread in the guidance thereafter. The 
ECMWF and its ensemble mean towards the end of the forecast is on 
the left side of the guidance envelope, while the GFS and HWRF 
models are currently on the right side. For the first NHC track 
forecast, I have elected to stay close to the track consensus aids, 
taking a blend of the HCCA and TCVN aids which are near the 
middle of the guidance envelope.

The environment ahead of the tropical depression appears quite 
favorable for intensification. Vertical wind shear is forecast by 
both the ECWMF- and GFS-based SHIPS guidance to stay at or under 10 
kt for the next 3-5 days as the storm traverses warm 28-29 C sea 
surface temperatures. Most of the guidance responds to this 
environment by indicating strengthening, and the NHC intensity 
guidance follows suit, showing a steady increase in intensity 
throughout the forecast period. While it might take a bit of time 
for the formative low-level circulation to become vertically aligned 
with the mid-level center, once that occurs, it is possible a period 
of rapid intensification could occur during the five day forecast. 
The forecast intensity by 120 hours (100 kt) is on the higher end of 
the guidance envelope, but not as high as the latest HWRF or HAFS-B 
forecasts.

        <pre style="text-align:center;">20W will continue on its current track under the subtropical ridge, making landfall 
        over Guam in around 15 hours. After 2 days, the system will turn more poleward 
        as it begins to round the western edge of the subtropical ridge, cresting the axis in around 78 hour, then 
        accelerate north-northeastward.
        The favorable environment will fuel intensification to 75-85 km/h (40-45 knots) prior to landfall over Guam, 
        tempered only by some subsidence associated with a TUTT to the north.
        After 24 hours, as the TUTT recedes, a more rapid intensification is expected, reaching 240 km/h (130 knots) 
        in 5 days as increased poleward outflow is anticipated in conjunction with initial exposure 
        to the strong westerlies ahead of a midlatitude trough.
        Available numerical models are in very loose agreement with the general track forecast with the 
        spread reaching 900+ nautical miles in 5 days mainly caused by UEMN on the extreme left margin of the model envelope.
        In view of this, there is medium confidence in the JTWC track forecast up to 3 days and low confidence afterward, 
        proportionally adjusted to the right of the model consensus to offset UEMN.
        There is also medium confidence in the intensirty forecast up to 5 days.
        Maximum significant wave height is 3.4 meters (11 feet).
